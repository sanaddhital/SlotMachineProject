# SlotMachineProject
I am designing a slot machine using javascript
Disclaimer: Say no to Gambling. This is just a fun project to learn javascript.



## Rules of our slot Machine:

1) User need to deposit some money to get started

2) User is going to bet on a certain number of lines (1, 2 or all 3 lines)

3) User is going to specify the amount they want to bet per line

4) The slot will spin —> for every line an user has bet on, they win only if the symbols match in a row. The amount won would be amount bet on that line multiplied by the value of multiplier of the symbol. For every line this doesn’t happen, user loses the money for the amount of bet they put on those losing line.

5) The lost amount is reduced from the balance and victory amount is added after every spin.
