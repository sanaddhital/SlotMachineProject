# SlotMachineProject
I am designing a slot machine using javascript
Disclaimer: Say no to Gambling. This is just a fun project to learn javascript.
Detailed description of the project: https://sanaddhital.notion.site/Slot-Machine-project-using-javascript-060b301f88044fe08003c00b8a95542b?pvs=4

## Rules of our slot Machine:

1) User need to deposit some money to get started

2) User is going to bet on a certain number of lines (1, 2 or all 3 lines)

3) User is going to specify the amount they want to bet per line

4) The slot will spin —> for every line an user has bet on, they win only if the symbols match in a row. The amount won would be amount bet on that line multiplied by the value of multiplier of the symbol. For every line this doesn’t happen, user loses the money for the amount of bet they put on those losing line.

5) The lost amount is reduced from the balance and victory amount is added after every spin.


## How to play??
To run this project, we need to use node environment in the directory and run the slot_machine.js file via terminal. Once run, follow these steps to play:

1) Deposit some money. We need to know how much money is user putting in the slot machine. 

2) Determine the number of lines to bet on. 1 line, 2 line or all the lines. 

3) Collect a bet amount. How much money are they betting per line? 

4) Spin the slot machine. 

5) Check if the user won.

6) Give the user their winnings. Deduct money if lost.

7) Play again or tell them they are out of money.
